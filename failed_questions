How much is an administrator's bond for a succession?

Answer

In Louisiana, the amount of an administrator's bond for a succession is typically equal to 125% of the value of the assets in the succession. The cost of the bond can vary. For example, a bond for $10,000 assets would cost $100, a bond for $25,000 would cost $135, a bond for $50,000 would cost $260, and a bond for $100,000 would cost $460. However, if you have a will, the person you name in that document will be appointed Executor and you can waive their bond (source: Louisiana Successions, Probate, and Estates | FAQs, Administrator or Executor Bonds in Louisiana). 

The bond is designed to protect the heirs and creditors of the estate in case the administrator fails to properly carry out their duties. The bond must be accompanied by affidavits of each surety that he is worth the amount for which he bound himself therein, in assets subject to execution, over and above all of his other obligations (CCP 5122). 

The court may appoint an attorney as administrator of a vacant succession and set his compensation. The attorney is required to furnish security as required by law (CCP 3121). 

It's always recommended to consult with a legal professional for specific situations.
