Art. 569.  Duties with regard to things gradually or totally impaired
If the usufructuary has not disposed of corporeal movables that are by their nature impaired by use, wear, or decay, he is bound to deliver them to the owner in the state in which they may be at the end of the usufruct.
The usufructuary is relieved of this obligation if the things are entirely worn out by normal use, wear, or decay.
