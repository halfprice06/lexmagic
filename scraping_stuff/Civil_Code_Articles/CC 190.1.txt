Art. 190.1.  Three-party acknowledgment; alternative to disavowal; time period
            If blood or tissue sampling indicates by a ninety-nine and nine-tenths percentage
point threshold probability that the biological father is the father of the child and he is not
the husband or former husband presumed to be the father of the child, then the husband or
former husband presumed to be the father of the child, the mother, and the biological father
of the child may execute a three-party acknowledgment in authentic form declaring that the
husband or former husband is not the father of the child and that the biological father is the
father of the child.  When a three-party acknowledgment is executed, the husband or former
husband is not presumed to be the father of the child.  The biological father who has
acknowledged the child by three-party acknowledgment is presumed to be the father of the
child.
            To have effect, this acknowledgment shall be executed no later than ten years from
the day of the birth of the child but never more than one year from the day of the death of the
child.  These time periods are peremptive.
            Acts 2018, No. 21, §2, eff. May 7, 2018.
