Art. 8.  Repeal of laws 
Laws are repealed, either entirely or partially, by other laws.
A repeal may be express or implied.  It is express when it is literally declared by a subsequent law.  It is implied when the new law contains provisions that are contrary to, or irreconcilable with, those of the former law.
The repeal of a repealing law does not revive the first law.
