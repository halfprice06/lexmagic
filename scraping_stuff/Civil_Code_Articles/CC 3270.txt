Art. 3270. Â Effect of priorities among privileges.
When the debts privileged on the movables and immovables can not be paid entirely, either because the movable effects are of small value, or subject to special privileges which claim a preference, or because the movables and immovables together do not suffice, the deficiency must not be borne proportionally among the debtors,* but the debts must be paid according to the order established above, and the loss must fall on those which are of inferior dignity.**
*Note error in English translation of French text; "debtors" should be "debts."
**English translation of French text incomplete; should include "and which cannot be discharged."
