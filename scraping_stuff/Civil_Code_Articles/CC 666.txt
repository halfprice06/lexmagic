Art. 666. Â River road; substitution if destroyed or impassable.
He who from his title as owner is bound to give a public road on the border of a river or stream, must furnish another without any compensation, if the first be destroyed or carried away.* 
And if the road be so injured or inundated by the water, without being carried away, that it becomes impassable, the owner is obliged to give the public a passage on his lands, as near as possible to the public road, without recompense therefor.
* English translation of French text incomplete; should include "by the stream."
