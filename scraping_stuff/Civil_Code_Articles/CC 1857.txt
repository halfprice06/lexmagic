Art. 1857.  Performance rendered to the obligee
Performance must be rendered to the obligee or to a person authorized by him.
However, a performance rendered to an unauthorized person is valid if the obligee ratifies it.
In the absence of ratification, a performance rendered to an unauthorized person is valid if the obligee has derived a benefit from it, but only for the amount of the benefit.
