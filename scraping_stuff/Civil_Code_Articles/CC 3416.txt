Art. 3416.  Tamed wild animals 
Tamed wild animals and birds are privately owned as long as they have the habit of returning to their owner.  They are considered to have lost the habit when they fail to return within a reasonable time.  In such a case, they are considered to have recovered their natural liberty unless their owner takes immediate measures for their pursuit and recapture.
