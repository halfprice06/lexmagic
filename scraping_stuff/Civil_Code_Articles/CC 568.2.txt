Art. 568.2.  Right to lease
The right to dispose of a nonconsumable thing includes the right to lease the thing for a term that extends beyond the termination of the usufruct.  If, at the termination of the usufruct, the thing remains subject to the lease, the usufructuary is accountable to the naked owner for any diminution in the value of the thing at that time attributable to the lease.
