Art. 2938.  Time of return
The depositary is bound to return the thing deposited upon demand, even if the agreed term of the deposit has not expired, unless expressly provided otherwise in the contract of deposit.
A depositary may not return the thing deposited before the lapse of the agreed term unless unforeseen circumstances make it impossible for him to keep the thing safely and without prejudice to himself.
When no term is fixed, the depositary may return the thing deposited at any time.
