Art. 3067.  Permissible variations 
A surety is not liable for a sum in excess of that expressly stated in his contract.  A legal suretyship may contain terms more favorable to the creditor than those required by the law or order pursuant to which it is given, but it may not provide for a time longer than is provided by law for bringing an action against the surety.
