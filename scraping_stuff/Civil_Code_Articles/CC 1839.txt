Art. 1839.  Transfer of immovable property
A transfer of immovable property must be made by authentic act or by act under private signature.  Nevertheless, an oral transfer is valid between the parties when the property has been actually delivered and the transferor recognizes the transfer when interrogated on oath.
An instrument involving immovable property shall have effect against third persons only from the time it is filed for registry in the parish where the property is located.
