Art. 1601.  Preference of payment among particular legacies
If the property remaining after payment of the debts and satisfaction of the legitime proves insufficient to discharge all particular legacies, the legacies of specific things must be discharged first and then the legacies of groups and collections of things.  Any remaining property must be applied toward the discharge of legacies of money, to be divided among the legatees of money in proportion to the amounts of their legacies.  When a legacy of money is expressly declared to be in recompense for services, it shall be paid in preference to all other legacies of money.
