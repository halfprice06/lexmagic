Art. 189.  Time limit for disavowal by the husband
            The action for disavowal of paternity is subject to a liberative prescription of one
year.  This prescription commences to run from the day of the birth of the child, or the day
the husband knew or should have known that he may not be the biological father of the child,
whichever occurs later.
            Nevertheless, if the husband lived separate and apart from the mother continuously
during the three hundred days immediately preceding the birth of the child, this prescription
does not commence to run until the husband is notified in writing that a party in interest has
asserted that the husband is the father of the child.
            Amended by Acts 1976, No. 430, §1; Acts 1999, No. 790, §1; Acts 2005, No. 192,
§1, eff. June 29, 2005; Acts 2016, No. 309, §1.
