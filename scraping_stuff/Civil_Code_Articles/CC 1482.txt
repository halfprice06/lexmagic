Art. 1482.  Proof of incapacity to donate
A.  A person who challenges the capacity of a donor must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the donor lacked capacity at the time the donor made the donation inter vivos or executed the testament.
B.  A full interdict lacks capacity to make or revoke a donation inter vivos or disposition mortis causa.
C.  A limited interdict, with respect to property under the authority of the curator, lacks capacity to make or revoke a donation inter vivos and is presumed to lack capacity to make or revoke a disposition mortis causa.  With respect to his other property, the limited interdict is presumed to have capacity to make or revoke a donation inter vivos or disposition mortis causa.  These presumptions may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.
