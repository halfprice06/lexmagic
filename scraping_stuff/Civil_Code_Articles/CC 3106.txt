Art. 3106. Â Penal clauses in submission.
It is usual to undergo* a penalty of a certain sum of money in the submission, which the person who shall contravene the award, or bring appeal therefrom, shall be bound to pay to the other who is willing to abide by it; but this covenant is not essential, and the submission may subsist without the penalty.
*Note error in English translation of French text; "undergo" should be "impose."
