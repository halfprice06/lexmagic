Art. 718.  Partition by licitation.
If the estate is partitioned by licitation and the co-owner who consented to the establishment of the predial servitude acquires the ownership of the whole, the servitude burdens the entire estate as if the co-owner had always been sole owner.  If the entire estate is adjudicated to any other person the right granted by the co-owner is extinguished.
