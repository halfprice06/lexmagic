Art. 3060.  Prescription of the surety's obligation, right of reimbursement, and contribution 
Prescription of the principal obligation extinguishes the obligation of the surety.  A surety's action for contribution from his co-sureties and his action for reimbursement from the principal obligor prescribe in ten years. 
The interruption of prescription against a surety is effective against the principal obligor and other sureties only when such parties have mutually agreed to be bound together with the surety against whom prescription was interrupted.
