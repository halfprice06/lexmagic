Art. 794.  Determination of ownership according to prescription.
When a party proves acquisitive prescription, the boundary shall be fixed according to limits established by prescription rather than titles.  If a party and his ancestors in title possessed for thirty years without interruption, within visible bounds, more land than their title called for, the boundary shall be fixed along these bounds.
