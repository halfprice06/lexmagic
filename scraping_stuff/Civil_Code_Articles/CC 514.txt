Art. 514.  Mixture of materials.
When a new thing is formed by the mixture of materials of different owners, and none of them may be considered as principal, an owner who has not consented to the mixture may demand separation if it can be conveniently made.
If separation cannot be conveniently made, the thing resulting from the mixture belongs to the owners of the materials in indivision.  The share of each is determined in proportion to the value of his materials.
One whose materials are far superior in value in comparison with those of any one of the others, may claim the thing resulting from the mixture.  He is then bound to reimburse the others the value of their materials.
