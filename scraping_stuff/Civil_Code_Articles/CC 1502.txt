Art. 1502.  Inability to satisfy legitime by usufruct or income interest in trust only
Nevertheless, the legitime may not be satisfied in whole or in part by a usufruct or an income interest in trust.  When a forced heir is both income and principal beneficiary of the same interest in trust, however, that interest shall be deemed a full ownership interest for purposes of satisfying the legitime if the trust conforms to the provisions of the Louisiana Trust Code governing the legitime in trust.
