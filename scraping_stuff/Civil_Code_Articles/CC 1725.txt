Art. 1725.  Method of making partition
These partitions may be made by act inter vivos or by testament.  If a testator has designated the quantum or value of his estate which he bequeaths to a legatee either by formula or by specific sum, he may expressly delegate to his executor the authority to select assets to satisfy the quantum or value.
