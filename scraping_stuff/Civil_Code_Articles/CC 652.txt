Art. 652.  Indivisibility of servitude.
A predial servitude is indivisible.  An estate cannot have upon another estate part of a right of way, or of view, or of any other servitude, nor can an estate be charged with a part of a servitude.
The use of a servitude may be limited to certain days or hours; when limited, it is still an entire right.  A servitude is due to the whole of the dominant estate and to all parts of it; if this estate is divided, every acquirer of a part has the right of using the servitude in its entirety.
