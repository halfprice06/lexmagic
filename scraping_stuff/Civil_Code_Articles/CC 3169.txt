Art. 3169.  Effectiveness against third persons
            The pledge of the lessor's rights in the lease of an immovable and its rents is without
effect as to third persons unless the contract establishing the pledge is recorded in the manner
prescribed by law.
            Nevertheless, the pledge is effective as to the lessee from the time that he is given
written notice of the pledge, regardless of whether the contract establishing the pledge has
been recorded.
