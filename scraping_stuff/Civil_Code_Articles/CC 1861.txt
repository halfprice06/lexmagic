Art. 1861.  Partial performance
An obligee may refuse to accept a partial performance.
Nevertheless, if the amount of an obligation to pay money is disputed in part and the obligor is willing to pay the undisputed part, the obligee may not refuse to accept that part.  If the obligee is willing to accept the undisputed part, the obligor must pay it.  In either case, the obligee preserves his right to claim the disputed part.
