Art. 1379.  Delivery of property and title papers after partition.
After the partition, delivery must be made to each of the coheirs, of the title papers of the objects fallen to his share.
The title papers of a divided property remain in the possession of the heir who has the most considerable part of it, under the obligation of producing them, when required by the coproprietors of the other part of the property.
Titles common to the whole inheritance shall be delivered to the person chosen by all the heirs to be the depositary of them, on condition of producing them as often as required.  If they should not agree on that choice, such deposit shall be made by the order of the judge.
