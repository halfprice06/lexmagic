SECTION 7.  RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGACIES
Art. 1611.  Intent of testator controls
A.  The intent of the testator controls the interpretation of his testament.  If the language of the testament is clear, its letter is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.  The following rules for interpretation apply only when the testator's intent cannot be ascertained from the language of the testament.  In applying these rules, the court may be aided by any competent evidence.
B.  When a testament uses a term the legal effect of which has been changed after the date of execution of the testament, the court may consider the law in effect at the time the testament was executed to ascertain the testator's intent in the interpretation of a legacy or other testamentary provision.
