Art. 3173.  Accounting to other pledgees for rent collected
            Except as provided in this Article, a pledgee is not bound to account to another
pledgee for rent collected.
            A pledgee shall account to the holder of a superior pledge for rent the pledgee collects
more than one month before it is due and for rent he collects with actual knowledge that the
payment of rent to him violated written directions given to the lessee to pay rent to the holder
of the superior pledge.
            After all secured obligations owed to a pledgee have been extinguished, he shall
deliver any remaining rent collected to another pledgee who has made written demand upon
him for the rent before he delivers it to the pledgor.
