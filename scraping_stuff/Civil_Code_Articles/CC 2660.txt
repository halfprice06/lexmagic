TITLE VIII--OF EXCHANGE
Art. 2660.  Exchange, definition
Exchange is a contract whereby each party transfers to the other the ownership of a thing other than money.
Ownership of the things exchanged is transferred between the parties as soon as there is agreement on the things, even though none of the things has been delivered.
If it is the intent of the parties that the transfer of ownership will not take place until a later time, then the contract is a contract to exchange.
