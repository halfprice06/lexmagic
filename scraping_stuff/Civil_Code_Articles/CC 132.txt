Art. 132.  Award of custody to parents
            If the parents agree who is to have custody, the court shall award custody in
accordance with their agreement unless the provisions of R.S. 9:364 apply or the best interest
of the child requires a different award.  Subject to the provisions of R.S. 9:364, in the
absence of agreement, or if the agreement is not in the best interest of the child, the court
shall award custody to the parents jointly; however, if custody in one parent is shown by
clear and convincing evidence to serve the best interest of the child, the court shall award
custody to that parent.
