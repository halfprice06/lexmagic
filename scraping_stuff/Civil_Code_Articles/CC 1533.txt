Art. 1533.  Right of return; effect
The effect of the right of return is that the thing donated returns to the donor free of any alienation, lease, or encumbrance made by the donee or his successors after the donation.
The right of return shall not apply, however, to a good faith transferee for value of the thing donated.  In such a case, the donee and his successors by gratuitous title are, nevertheless, accountable for the loss sustained by the donor.
Amended by Acts 1974, No. 210, §1; Acts 2008, No. 204, §1, eff. Jan. 1, 2009.
