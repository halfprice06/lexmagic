Art. 1276. Â Payment of collation with property of succession.
If, on the contrary, the coheirs to whom the collation is due prefer to be paid the amount thereof in property and effects of the succession, or are divested of their right to require the sale of these effects, * they shall be paid the amount of the collation in movables, immovables and other effects of the succession, in the same manner as is prescribed in the chapter which treats of partitions.
But in no case will these heirs be obliged to receive in payment credits of the succession.
* English translation of French text incomplete; should include "as is said in the preceding article."
