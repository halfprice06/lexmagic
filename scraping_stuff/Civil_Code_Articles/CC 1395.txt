Art. 1395. Â Tacit mortgage abolished.
The tacit mortgage which resulted from the partition for the execution of all the obligations contained therein, * no longer exists; but the heirs may stipulate a special mortgage.**
* English translation of French text incomplete; should include "or flowing therefrom."
** Note error in English translation of French text; "a special mortgage" should be "an express mortgage, if they see fit."
