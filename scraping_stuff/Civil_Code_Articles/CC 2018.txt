Art. 2018.  Effects of dissolution
Upon dissolution of a contract, the parties shall be restored to the situation that existed before the contract was made.  If restoration in kind is impossible or impracticable, the court may award damages.
If partial performance has been rendered and that performance is of value to the party seeking to dissolve the contract, the dissolution does not preclude recovery for that performance, whether in contract or quasi-contract.
