Art. 2522.  Notice of existence of defect
The buyer must give the seller notice of the existence of a redhibitory defect in the thing sold.  That notice must be sufficiently timely as to allow the seller the opportunity to make the required repairs.  A buyer who fails to give that notice suffers diminution of the warranty to the extent the seller can show that the defect could have been repaired or that the repairs would have been less burdensome, had he received timely notice.
Such notice is not required when the seller has actual knowledge of the existence of a redhibitory defect in the thing sold.
