Art. 2930.  Diligence and prudence required
When the deposit is onerous, the depositary is bound to fulfill his obligations with diligence and prudence.
When the deposit is gratuitous, the depositary is bound to fulfill his obligations with the same diligence and prudence in caring for the thing deposited that he uses for his own property.
Whether the deposit is gratuitous or onerous, the depositary is liable for the loss that the depositor sustains as a result of the depositary's failure to perform such obligations.
