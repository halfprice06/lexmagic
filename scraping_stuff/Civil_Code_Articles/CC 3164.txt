Art. 3164.  Modification of contract from which a pledged obligation arises
            The parties to a contract from which a pledged obligation arises may agree to modify
or terminate the contract or to substitute a new contract.  If made in good faith, the agreement
is effective against the pledgee without his consent.  Nevertheless, after written notice of the
pledge is given to the obligor of a pledged obligation that has been fully earned by the
pledgor's performance, an agreement modifying or extinguishing the pledged obligation is
without effect against the pledgee unless made with his consent.
