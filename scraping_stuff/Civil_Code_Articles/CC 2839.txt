Art. 2839.  Name of partner in commendam; use
A.  A partner in commendam becomes liable as a general partner if he permits his name to be used in business dealings of the partnership in a manner that implies he is a general partner.
B.  If the name of a partner in commendam is used without his consent, he is liable as a general partner only if he knew or should have known of its use and did not take reasonable steps to prevent the use.
C.  If the name of the partner in commendam is the same as that of a general partner or if it had been included in the name of a predecessor business entity or in the name of the partnership prior to the admission of the partner in commendam, its use does not imply that he is a general partner.
