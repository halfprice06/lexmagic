Art. 896.  Separate property; rights of other collaterals
           If the deceased leaves neither descendants, nor brothers, sisters, or
descendants from them, nor parents, nor spouse not judicially separated, nor
other ascendants, his other collaterals succeed to his separate property.  Among
the collateral relations, the nearest in degree excludes all the others.  If there
are several in the same degree, they take equally and by heads.
