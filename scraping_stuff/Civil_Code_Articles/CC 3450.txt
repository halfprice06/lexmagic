Art. 3450.  Express or tacit renunciation 
Renunciation may be express or tacit.  Tacit renunciation results from circumstances that give rise to a presumption that the advantages of prescription have been abandoned.
Nevertheless, with respect to immovables, renunciation of acquisitive prescription must be express and in writing.
