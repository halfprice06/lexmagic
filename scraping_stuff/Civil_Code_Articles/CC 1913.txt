Art. 1913.  Principal and accessory contracts
A contract is accessory when it is made to provide security for the performance of an obligation.  Suretyship, mortgage, pledge, and other types of security agreements are examples of such a contract.
When the secured obligation arises from a contract, either between the same or other parties, that contract is the principal contract.
