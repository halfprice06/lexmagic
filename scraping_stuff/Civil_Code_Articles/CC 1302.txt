Art. 1302.  Testamentary partition
There is no occasion for partition, if the deceased has regulated it between his lawful heirs, or strangers, or if the deceased has expressly delegated the authority to his executor to allocate specific assets to satisfy a legacy expressed in terms of a quantum or value; and in such case the judge must follow the will of the testator or his executor.
The same thing takes place when the testator has expressly assigned specific assets of his estate, or delegated the authority to assign specific assets of his estate, in satisfaction of the forced portion of his children.
