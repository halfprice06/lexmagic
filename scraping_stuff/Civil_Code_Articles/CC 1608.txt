(1)  So declares in one of the forms prescribed for testaments.
(2)  Makes a subsequent incompatible testamentary disposition or provision.
(3)  Makes a subsequent inter vivos disposition of the thing that is the object of the legacy and does not reacquire it.
(4)  Clearly revokes the provision or legacy by a signed writing on the testament itself.
