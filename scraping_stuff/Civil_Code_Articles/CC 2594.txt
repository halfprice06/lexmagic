Art. 2594.  Lesion, action against vendee who has resold the immovable
When the buyer has sold the immovable, the seller may not bring an action for lesion against a third person who bought the immovable from the original buyer.
In such a case the seller may recover from the original buyer whatever profit the latter realized from the sale to the third person.  That recovery may not exceed the supplement the seller would have recovered if the original buyer had chosen to keep the immovable.
