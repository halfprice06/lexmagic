Art. 1405. Â Sale of succession rights to coheir at risk of vendor, rescission inadmissible.
The sale of successive rights by one heir to his coheir is not subject * to rescission, if the purchaser has run no risk; as, for example, if the vendor remains bound for the payment of the debts.
* Note error in English translation of French text; "is not subject" should be "is subject."
