Art. 2434.  Quantum
The marital portion is one-fourth of the succession in ownership if the deceased died without children, the same fraction in usufruct for life if he is survived by three or fewer children, and a child's share in such usufruct if he is survived by more than three children.  In no event, however, shall the amount of the marital portion exceed one million dollars.
