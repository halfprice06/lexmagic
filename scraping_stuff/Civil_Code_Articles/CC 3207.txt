Art. 3207.  Wages recoverable but not privileged.
As to the wages of preceding years which may be due, the wages may be recovered, if there is any balanced account, note or obligation of the debtor, but they enjoy no privilege.  They form an ordinary debt, for which domestics or servants come in by contribution with other ordinary creditors.
