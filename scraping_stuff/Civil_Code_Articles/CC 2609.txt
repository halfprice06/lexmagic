Art. 2609.  Purchase of substitute things by the buyer
When the seller fails to render the performance required by a contract of sale of movable things, the buyer may purchase substitute things within a reasonable time and in good faith.  In such a case the buyer is entitled to recover the difference between the contract price and the price of the substitute things.  The buyer may recover other damages also, less the expenses saved as a result of the failure of the seller to perform.
