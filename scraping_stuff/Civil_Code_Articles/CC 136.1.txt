Art. 136.1. Award of visitation rights
A child has a right to time with both parents. Accordingly, when a court-ordered schedule of visitation, custody, or time to be spent with a child has been entered, a parent shall exercise his rights to the child in accordance with the schedule unless good cause is shown.  Neither parent shall interfere with the visitation, custody or time rights of the other unless good cause is shown.
