Art. 2302.  Payment of the debt of another person
A person who paid the debt of another person in the erroneous belief that he was himself the obligor may reclaim the payment from the obligee.  The payment may not be reclaimed to the extent that the obligee, because of the payment, disposed of the instrument or released the securities relating to the claim.  In such a case, the person who made the payment has a recourse against the true obligor.
