§6--OF THE PRIVILEGE OF CLERKS
Art. 3214.  Clerks and secretaries, extent and rank of privilege for salaries.
Although clerks, secretaries and other agents of that sort can not be included under the denomination of servants, yet a privilege is granted them for their salaries for the last year elapsed, and so much as has elapsed of the current year.  This privilege, however, can not be enforced until after that of the furnishers of provisions.
