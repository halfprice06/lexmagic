Art. 3260. Â Ranking between privileges of lessor and depositor.
If, among the movables with which the house or farm, or any other thing subject to the lessor's privilege, is provided, there should be some which were deposited by a third person in the hands of the lessor* or farmer, the lessor shall have a preference over the depositary** on the things deposited for the payment of his rent, if there are no other movables subject to his privilege, or if they are not sufficient; unless it be proved that the lessor knew that the things deposited did not belong to his tenant or farmer.
Amended by Acts 1871, No. 87.
