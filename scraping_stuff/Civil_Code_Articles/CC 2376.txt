Art. 2376.  Rights of creditors.
The creditors of a spouse, by intervention in the proceeding, may object to the separation of property or modification of their matrimonial regime as being in fraud of their rights.  They also may sue to annul a judgment of separation of property within one year from the date of the rendition of the final judgment.  After execution of the judgment, they may assert nullity only to the extent that they have been prejudiced.
