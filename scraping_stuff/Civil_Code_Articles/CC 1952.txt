Art. 1952.  Rescission; liability for damages
A party who obtains rescission on grounds of his own error is liable for the loss thereby sustained by the other party unless the latter knew or should have known of the error.
The court may refuse rescission when the effective protection of the other party's interest requires that the contract be upheld.  In that case, a reasonable compensation for the loss he has sustained may be granted to the party to whom rescission is refused.
