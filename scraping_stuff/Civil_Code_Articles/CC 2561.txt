Art. 2561.  Dissolution of sale for nonpayment of price
If the buyer fails to pay the price, the seller may sue for dissolution of the sale.  If the seller has given credit for the price and transfers that credit to another person, the right of dissolution is transferred together with the credit.  In case of multiple credit holders all must join in the suit for dissolution, but if any credit holder refuses to join, the others may subrogate themselves to his right by paying the amount due to him.
If a promissory note or other instrument has been given for the price, the right to dissolution prescribes at the same time and in the same period as the note or other instrument.
Amended by Acts 1924, No. 108; Acts 1993, No. 841, §1, eff. Jan. 1, 1995.
