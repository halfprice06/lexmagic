Art. 2477.  Methods of making delivery
Delivery of an immovable is deemed to take place upon execution of the writing that transfers its ownership.
Delivery of a movable takes place by handing it over to the buyer.  If the parties so intend delivery may take place in another manner, such as by the seller's handing over to the buyer the key to the place where the thing is stored, or by negotiating to him a document of title to the thing, or even by the mere consent of the parties if the thing sold cannot be transported at the time of the sale or if the buyer already has the thing at that time.
