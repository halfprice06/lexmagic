Art. 1575.  Olographic testament
A.  An olographic testament is one entirely written, dated, and signed in the handwriting of the testator.  Although the date may appear anywhere in the testament, the testator must sign the testament at the end of the testament.  If anything is written by the testator after his signature, the testament shall not be invalid and such writing may be considered by the court, in its discretion, as part of the testament.  The olographic testament is subject to no other requirement as to form.  The date is sufficiently indicated if the day, month, and year are reasonably ascertainable from information in the testament, as clarified by extrinsic evidence, if necessary.
B.  Additions and deletions on the testament may be given effect only if made by the hand of the testator.
