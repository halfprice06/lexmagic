Art. 152.  Proceeding for declaration of nullity of a marriage; final incidental relief 
After the declaration of nullity of a marriage, a party entitled to the civil effects of marriage may seek the same relief as may a divorced spouse.
Incidental relief granted pending declaration of nullity to a party not entitled to the civil effects of marriage shall terminate upon the declaration of nullity.
Nevertheless, a party not entitled to the civil effects of marriage may be awarded custody, child support, or visitation.  The award shall not terminate as a result of the declaration of nullity.
