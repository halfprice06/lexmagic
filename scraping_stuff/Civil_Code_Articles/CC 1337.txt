Art. 1337. Â Partition in kind; sale of movables to pay debts.
Each of the coheirs may demand in kind his share of the movables and immovables of the succession; but if there are creditors who have made any seizure or opposition, or if a majority of the coheirs are of opinion that the sale is necessary in order to satisfy the debts and charges of the succession, the movables shall be sold at public auction, after the usual advertisements.
