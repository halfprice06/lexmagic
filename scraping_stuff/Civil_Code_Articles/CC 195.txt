SUBSECTION B.  PRESUMPTION OF PATERNITY BY SUBSEQUENT
MARRIAGE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENT
Art. 195.  Presumption by marriage and acknowledgment; child not filiated to another man;
proof; time period
            A man who marries the mother of a child not filiated to another man and who, with
the concurrence of the mother, acknowledges the child by authentic act is presumed to be the
father of that child.
            The husband may disavow paternity of the child as provided in Article 187. 
Revocation of the authentic act of acknowledgment alone is not sufficient to rebut the
presumption of paternity created by this Article.
            The action for disavowal is subject to a peremptive period of one hundred eighty
days.  This peremptive period commences to run from the day of the marriage or the
acknowledgment, whichever occurs later.
