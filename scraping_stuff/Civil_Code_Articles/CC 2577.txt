Art. 2577.  Ownership of improvements and augmentations pending redemption
The buyer is entitled to all improvements he made on the thing that can be removed when the seller exercises the right of redemption.  If such improvements cannot be removed, the buyer is entitled to the enhancement of the value of the thing resulting from the improvements.  The buyer is also entitled to the enhancement of the value of the thing resulting from ungathered fruits and unharvested crops.
If the thing sold under right of redemption is naturally increased by accession, alluvion, or accretion before the redeeming seller exercises the right, the increase belongs to the seller.
