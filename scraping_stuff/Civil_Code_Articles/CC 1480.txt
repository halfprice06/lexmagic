Art. 1480.  Nullity due to fraud, duress, or undue influence; severability of valid provision
When a donation inter vivos or mortis causa is declared null because of undue influence or because of fraud or duress, it is not necessary that the entire act of donation or testament be nullified.  If any provision contained in it is not the product of such means, that provision shall be given effect, unless it is otherwise invalid.
