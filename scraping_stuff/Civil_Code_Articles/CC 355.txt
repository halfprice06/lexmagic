Art. 355.  Petition for continuing or permanent tutorship
            When a person above the age of fifteen possesses less than two-thirds of the
intellectual functioning of a person of the same age with average intellectual functioning,
evidenced by standard testing procedures administered by competent persons or other
relevant evidence acceptable to the court, the parents of such person, or the person entitled
to custody or tutorship if one or both parents are dead, incapacitated, or absent persons, or
if the parents are judicially separated or divorced or have never been married to each other,
may, with the written concurrence of the coroner of the parish of the intellectually disabled
person's domicile, petition the court of that district to place such person under a continuing
tutorship which shall not automatically end at any age but shall continue until revoked by the
court of domicile. The petitioner shall not bear the coroner's costs or fees associated with
securing the coroner's concurrence.
