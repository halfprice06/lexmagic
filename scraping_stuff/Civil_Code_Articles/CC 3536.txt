Art. 3536.  Real rights in corporeal movables 
Real rights in corporeal movables are governed by the law of the state in which the movable was situated at the time the right was acquired. 
Nevertheless, after the removal of a movable to this state, a real right acquired while the movable was situated in another state is subject to the law of this state if: (1) the right is incompatible with the law of this state; or (2) the holder of the right knew or should have known of the removal to this state; or (3) justice and equity so dictate in order to protect third parties who, in good faith, have dealt with the thing after its removal to this state.
