Art. 568.  Disposition of nonconsumable things
The usufructuary may not dispose of nonconsumable things unless the right to do so has been expressly granted to him.  Nevertheless, he may dispose of corporeal movables that are gradually and substantially impaired by use, wear, or decay, such as equipment, appliances, and vehicles, provided that he acts as a prudent administrator.
The right to dispose of a nonconsumable thing includes the rights to lease, alienate, and encumber the thing.  It does not include the right to alienate by donation inter vivos, unless that right is expressly granted.
