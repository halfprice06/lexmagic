Art. 481.  Ownership and possession distinguished.
The ownership and the possession of a thing are distinct.
Ownership exists independently of any exercise of it and may not be lost by nonuse.  Ownership is lost when acquisitive prescription accrues in favor of an adverse possessor.
Acts 1979, No. 180, §1.
