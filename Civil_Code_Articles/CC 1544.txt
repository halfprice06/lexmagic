Art. 1544.  Donation effective from time of acceptance
A donation inter vivos is without effect until it is accepted by the donee.  The acceptance shall be made during the lifetime of the donor.
The acceptance of a donation may be made in the act of donation or subsequently in writing.
When the donee is put into corporeal possession of a movable by the donor, possession by the donee also constitutes acceptance of the donation.
