Art. 599.  Usufruct of a herd of animals.
When the usufruct includes a herd of animals, the usufructuary is bound to use it as a prudent administrator and, from the increase of the herd, replace animals that die.  If the entire herd perishes without the fault of the usufructuary, the loss is borne by the naked owner.
