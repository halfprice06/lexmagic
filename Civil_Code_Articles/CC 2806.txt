Art. 2806.  Ownership of immovable property; retroactivity of partnership's existence; acquisition of immovable property prior to partnership's existence
A.  An immovable acquired in the name of a partnership is owned by the partnership if, at the time of acquisition, the contract of partnership was in writing.  If the contract of partnership was not in writing at the time of acquisition, the immovable is owned by the partners.
B.  As to third parties, the individual partners shall be deemed to own immovable property acquired in the name of the partnership until the contract of partnership is filed for registry with the secretary of state as provided by law.
C.  Whenever any immovable property is acquired by one or more persons acting in any capacity for and in the name of any partnership which has not been created by contract as required by law, and the partnership is subsequently created by contract in accordance with Title XI of Book III of the Civil Code, the partnership's existence shall be retroactive to the date of acquisition of an interest in such immovable property, but such retroactive effect shall be without prejudice to rights validly acquired by third persons in the interim between the date of acquisition and the date that the partnership was created by contract.
