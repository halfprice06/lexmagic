Art. 674.  Contribution by neighbor.
The wall thus raised becomes common if the neighbor is willing to contribute one-half of its cost.  If the neighbor refuses to contribute, he preserves the right to make the wall common in whole or in part, at any time, by paying to the owner one-half of the current value of the wall, or of the part that he wishes to make common.
