Art. 2336.  Ownership of community property
Each spouse owns a present undivided one-half interest in the community property.  Nevertheless, neither the community nor things of the community may be judicially partitioned prior to the termination of the regime.
During the existence of the community property regime, the spouses may, without court approval, voluntarily partition the community property in whole or in part. In such a case, the things that each spouse acquires are separate property.  The partition is effective toward third persons when filed for registry in the manner provided by Article 2332.
Acts 1979, No. 709, §1.  Amended by Acts 1981, No. 921, §1; Acts 1982, No. 282, §1.
