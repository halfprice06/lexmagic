Art. 1400.  Provisional partitions involving minors, interdicts, or absent persons
But if these formalities have not been fulfilled, as the partition is only considered as provisional, it is not necessary to sue for the rescission of it, but a new partition may be demanded for the least lesion, which the minor, person interdicted, or absent person, may have suffered.
