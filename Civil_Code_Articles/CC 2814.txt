CHAPTER 3--RELATIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE
PARTNERS WITH THIRD PERSONS
Art. 2814.  Partner as mandatary of the partnership
A partner is a mandatary of the partnership for all matters in the ordinary course of its business other than the alienation, lease, or encumbrance of its immovables.  A provision that a partner is not a mandatary does not affect third persons who in good faith transact business with the partner.  Except as provided in the articles of partnership, any person authorized to execute a mortgage or security agreement on behalf of a partnership shall, for purposes of executory process, have authority to execute a confession of judgment in the act of mortgage or security agreement without execution of the articles of partnership by authentic act.
