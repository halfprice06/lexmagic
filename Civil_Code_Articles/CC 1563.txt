Art. 1563.  Nonfulfillment of conditions or nonperformance of charges that donee can perform or prevent
If a donation is made on a condition that the donee has the power to perform or prevent, or depends on the performance of a charge by the donee, the nonfulfillment of the condition or the nonperformance of the charge does not, of right, operate a dissolution of the donation.  It may be dissolved only by consent of the parties or by judicial decree.
