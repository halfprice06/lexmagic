Art. 117.  Peremptive period for obligation
The right to claim after divorce the obligation of spousal support is subject to a peremption of three years.  Peremption begins to run from the latest of the following events:
(1)  The day the judgment of divorce is signed.
(2)  The day a judgment terminating a previous judgment of spousal support is signed, if the previous judgment was signed in an action commenced either before the signing of the judgment of divorce or within three years thereafter.
(3)  The day of the last payment made, when the spousal support obligation is initially performed by voluntary payment within the periods described in Paragraph (1) or (2) and no more than three years has elapsed between payments.
