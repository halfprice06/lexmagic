Art. 3161.  Performance by obligor of a pledged obligation
            A third person obligated on a pledged obligation is bound to render performance to
the pledgee only from the time that the pledgor or pledgee notifies him of the pledge and
directs him in writing to render performance to the pledgee.  Performance that the third
person renders to the pledgor before that time extinguishes the pledged obligation and is
effective against the pledgee.
