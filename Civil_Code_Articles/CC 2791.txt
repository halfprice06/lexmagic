Art. 2791.  Enforcement of the annuity charge
Upon failure of payment of amounts due under a contract establishing an annuity charge, the recipient may obtain judgment for the amounts due and may enforce the judgment by execution upon the immovable subject to the annuity charge in accordance with law.
The adjudication extinguishes the annuity charge for all amounts for which judgment was rendered as well as all charges and encumbrances on the immovable inferior to the annuity charge but does not extinguish the annuity charge for amounts thereafter becoming due under the contract.
