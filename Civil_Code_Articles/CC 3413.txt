Art. 3413.  Wild animals, birds, fish, and shellfish 
Wild animals, birds, fish, and shellfish in a state of natural liberty either belong to the state in its capacity as a public person or are things without an owner.  The taking of possession of such things is governed by particular laws and regulations.
The owner of a tract of land may forbid entry to anyone for purposes of hunting or fishing, and the like.  Nevertheless, despite a prohibition of entry, captured wildlife belongs to the captor.
