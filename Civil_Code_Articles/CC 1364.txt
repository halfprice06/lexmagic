Art. 1364. Â Division into lots according to number of heirs or roots.
When the deductions have been made, and those to whom the collations were due have received them, as is said in the preceding article, the officer divides what remains into as many equal lots as there are heirs, or roots entitled to a share.
No subdivision of the lots thus formed need be made between the individual coproprietors claiming under the same root.
A partition thus made, even without a subdivision being made of the lots to which each root may be entitled, shall be a definitive partition.
