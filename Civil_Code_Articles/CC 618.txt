Art. 618.  Security for proceeds
In cases governed by Articles 614, 615, 616, and the first sentence of Article 617, the naked owner may demand, within one year from receipt of the proceeds by the usufructuary that the usufructuary give security for the proceeds.  If such a demand is made, and the parties cannot agree, the nature of the security shall be determined by the court.  This Article does not apply to corporeal movables referred to in the second sentence of Article 568, or to property disposed of by the usufructuary pursuant to the power to dispose of nonconsumables if the grantor of the usufruct has dispensed with the security.
