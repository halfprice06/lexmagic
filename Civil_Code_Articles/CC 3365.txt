Art. 3365.  Effect of notice recorded after cessation of effect of recordation
              A notice of reinscription that is recorded after the effect of recordation of the
instrument sought to be reinscribed has ceased, again produces the effects of recordation, but
only from the time that the notice of reinscription is recorded. The effect of recordation
pursuant to this Article shall continue for ten years from the date on which the notice of
reinscription is recorded, and the instrument may be reinscribed thereafter from time to time
as provided by Article 3362.
              Reinscription pursuant to this Article does not require that the mortgage or pledge
or evidence of privilege be again recorded, even if the original recordation has been
cancelled.
