Art. 1295. Â Definitive and provisional partitions, definitions.
Every partition is either definitive or provisional:

Provisional partition is that which is made provisionally, either of certain things before the rest can be divided, or even of everything that is to be divided, when the parties are not in a situation to make an irrevocable partition.
