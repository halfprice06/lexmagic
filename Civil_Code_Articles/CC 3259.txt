Art. 3259. Â Lessor's privilege on crops primed by supplies and labor.
With regard to the crops which are subject to the lessor's privilege, the expenses for seed and labor, the wages of overseers and managers are to be paid out of the product of the year, in preference to the lessor's debt. 
So, also, he who supplied the farming utensils, and who has not been paid, is paid in preference to the lessor out of the price of their sale.
