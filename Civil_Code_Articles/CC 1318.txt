Art. 1318. Â Partition by or against heir or successor of co-owner.
Not only the coheir himself, but the heirs of that coheir, and any other successor can compel a partition of the estate, * and be themselves compelled to make it.
* Note error in English translation of French text; "estate" should be "succession."
