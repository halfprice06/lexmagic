Art. 1388. Â Amount of indemnity.
But the indemnity is only for the sum for which the object has been given by the partition to the heir who has suffered the eviction, and for the proportion which each of the heirs is bound to contribute, the amount of his own portion being extinguished by confusion; and the heir in this case has no right to claim remuneration from his coheirs for any damages which he may have suffered by the eviction.
