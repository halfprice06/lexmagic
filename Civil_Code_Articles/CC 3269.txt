Art. 3269.  Order of payment out of immovables; distribution of loss among mortgage
creditors
            With the exception of special privileges that exist on immovables in favor of vendors
and other creditors, as declared above, the debts privileged on the movables and immovables
generally ought to be paid, if the movables are insufficient, out of the product of the
immovables belonging to the debtor, in preference to all other privileged and mortgage
creditors.
            The loss which may then result from their payment must be borne by the creditor
whose mortgage is the least ancient, and so in succession, ascending according to the order
of the mortgages, or by pro rata contributions where two or more mortgages have the same
date.
            Amended by Acts 2019, No. 325, §2, eff. Jan. 1, 2020.
