Art. 2353.  Unauthorized alienation of community property.
When the concurrence of the spouses is required by law, the alienation, encumbrance, or lease of community property by a spouse is relatively null unless the other spouse has renounced the right to concur.  Also, the alienation, encumbrance, or lease of the assets of a community enterprise by the non-manager spouse is a relative nullity.
