Art. 3419.1.  Lost things; domestic animals
            To claim ownership of a domestic animal pursuant to Article 3419 or 3490, the
possessor shall prove that the animal when acquired lacked a microchip or other owner-identifying information such as a collar, rabies tag, or tattoo. The presence of owner-identifying information creates a rebuttable presumption that the possessor has not satisfied
the requirements for ownership under Article 3419 or 3490.
