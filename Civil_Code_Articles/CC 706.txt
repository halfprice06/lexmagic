Art. 706.  Servitudes; affirmative or negative.
Predial servitudes are either affirmative or negative.
Affirmative servitudes are those that give the right to the owner of the dominant estate to do a certain thing on the servient estate.  Such are the servitudes of right of way, drain, and support.
Negative servitudes are those that impose on the owner of the servient estate the duty to abstain from doing something on his estate.  Such are the servitudes of prohibition of building and of the use of an estate as a commercial or industrial establishment.
