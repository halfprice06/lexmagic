SECTION 2--EFFECTS OF TERMINATION OF
PARTNERSHIP AND RIGHTS OF FORMER PARTNERS
Art. 2830.  Effects of termination; authority of partners.
When a partnership terminates, the authority of the partners to act for it ceases, except with regard to acts necessary to liquidate its affairs.
Anything done in what would have been the usual course of business of the partnership by a partner acting in good faith, who is unaware that the partnership has terminated, binds the partnership as if it still existed.
