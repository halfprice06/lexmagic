Art. 1309. Â Partition between possessors in common.
It is not indispensable to be owner in common in order to be able to support the action of partition; possession alone, when it is lawful and proceeds from a just title, will support it.
Thus, usufructuaries of the same estate can institute among themselves the action of partition.
