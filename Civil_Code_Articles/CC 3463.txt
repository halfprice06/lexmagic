Art. 3463.  Duration of interruption; abandonment or discontinuance of suit
            A.  An interruption of prescription resulting from the filing of a suit in a competent
court and in the proper venue or from service of process within the prescriptive period
continues as long as the suit is pending.
            B.  Interruption is considered never to have occurred if the plaintiff abandons the suit,
voluntarily dismisses the suit at any time either before the defendant has made any
appearance of record or thereafter, or fails to prosecute the suit at the trial.  The dismissal of
a suit pursuant to a compromise does not constitute a voluntary dismissal.
