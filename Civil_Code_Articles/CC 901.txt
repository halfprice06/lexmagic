Art. 901.  Direct and collateral relationship
           The series of degrees forms the line.  The direct line is the series of
degrees between persons who descend one from another.  The collateral line
is the series of degrees between persons who do not descend one from another,
but who descend from a common ancestor.
           In the direct line, the number of degrees is equal to the number of
generations between the heir and the deceased.  In the collateral line, the
number of degrees is equal to the number of generations between the heir and
the common ancestor, plus the number of generations between the common
ancestor and the deceased.
