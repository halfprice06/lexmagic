Art. 2608.  Merchant buyer's duty upon rejection of things
When the seller has no agent or business office at the place of delivery, a buyer who is a merchant and has rejected the things must follow any reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to those things.  If the seller gives no such instructions, and the things rejected are perishable or susceptible of rapid decline in value, the merchant buyer must make reasonable efforts to sell those things on the seller's behalf.
In all instances of rejection, a buyer who is a merchant must handle the rejected things as a prudent administrator.
