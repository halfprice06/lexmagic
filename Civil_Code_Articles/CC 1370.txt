Art. 1370. Â Subdivision among coheirs of same root.
The rules established for the division of estates to be partitioned, are equally applicable to the subdivisions to be made between the individual coproprietors claiming under the same root.*
* Note error in English translation of French text; "individual co-proprietors claiming under the same root" should be "roots participating."
