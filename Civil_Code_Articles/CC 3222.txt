§3--OF THE PRIVILEGE OF A DEPOSITOR
Art. 3222.  Privilege of depositor on thing deposited.
He who deposits a thing in the hands of another still remains the owner of it.
Consequently his claim to it is preferred to that of the other creditors of the depositary, and he may demand the restitution of it,* if he can prove the deposit, in the same manner as is required in agreements for sums of money, and if the thing reclaimed be identically the same which he deposited.
*English translation of French text incomplete; should include "in kind."
