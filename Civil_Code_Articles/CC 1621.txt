Art. 1621.  Children; causes for disinherison by parents
A.  A parent has just cause to disinherit a child if:
(1)  The child has raised his hand to strike a parent, or has actually struck a parent; but a mere threat is not sufficient.
(2)  The child has been guilty, towards a parent, of cruel treatment, crime, or grievous injury.
(3)  The child has attempted to take the life of a parent.
(4)  The child, without any reasonable basis, has accused a parent of committing a crime for which the law provides that the punishment could be life imprisonment or death.
(5)  The child has used any act of violence or coercion to hinder a parent from making a testament.
(6)  The child, being a minor, has married without the consent of the parent.
(7)  The child has been convicted of a crime for which the law provides that the punishment could be life imprisonment or death.
(8)  The child, after attaining the age of majority and knowing how to contact the parent, has failed to communicate with the parent without just cause for a period of two years, unless the child was on active duty in any of the military forces of the United States at the time.
B.  For a disinherison to be valid, the cause must have occurred prior to the execution of the instrument that disinherits the heir.
