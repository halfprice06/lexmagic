The parties may agree to an exclusion or limitation of the warranty against redhibitory defects.  The terms of the exclusion or limitation must be clear and unambiguous and must be brought to the attention of the buyer.
A buyer is not bound by an otherwise effective exclusion or limitation of the warranty when the seller has declared that the thing has a quality that he knew it did not have.
The buyer is subrogated to the rights in warranty of the seller against other persons, even when the warranty is excluded.
