Art. 598.  Duty to give information to owner.
If, during the existence of the usufruct, a third person encroaches on the immovable property or violates in any other way the rights of the naked owner, the usufructuary must inform the naked owner.  When he fails to do so, he shall be answerable for the damages that the naked owner may suffer.
