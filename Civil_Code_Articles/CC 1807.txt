SECTION 6.  CONJUNCTIVE AND ALTERNATIVE OBLIGATIONS
Art. 1807.  Conjunctive obligation
An obligation is conjunctive when it binds the obligor to multiple items of performance that may be separately rendered or enforced.  In that case, each item is regarded as the object of a separate obligation.
The parties may provide that the failure of the obligor to perform one or more items shall allow the obligee to demand the immediate performance of all the remaining items.
