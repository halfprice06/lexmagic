Art. 310. Â Liability for failure to make application.
Relations who have neglected to cause a tutor to be appointed, are responsible for the damages which the minor may have suffered.
This responsibility is enforced against relations in the order according to which they are called to the inheritance of the minor, so that they are responsible only in case of the insolvency of him or them who precede them in that order, and this responsibility is not in solidum between relations who have a right to the inheritance in the same degree.
