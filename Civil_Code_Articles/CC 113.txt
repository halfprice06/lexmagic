            A.  Upon motion of a party, the court may award a party interim spousal support

support obligation, and the standard of living of the parties during the marriage.  An award
of interim spousal support shall terminate one hundred eighty days from the rendition of a
judgment of divorce, except that the award may extend beyond one hundred eighty days but
only for good cause shown.
            B.  An obligation to pay final periodic support shall not begin until an interim spousal
support award has terminated.
