Art. 508.  Things principal and accessory
Things are divided into principal and accessory.  For purposes of accession as between movables, an accessory is a corporeal movable that serves the use, ornament, or complement of the principal thing.
In the case of a principal thing consisting of a movable construction permanently attached to the ground, its accessories include things that would constitute its component parts under Article 466 if the construction were immovable.
