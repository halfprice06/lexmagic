Art. 872.  Meaning of estate
           The estate of a deceased means the property, rights, and obligations that
a person leaves after his death, whether the property exceeds the charges or the
charges exceed the property, or whether he has only left charges without any
property.  The estate includes not only the rights and obligations of the
deceased as they exist at the time of death, but all that has accrued thereto
since death, and the new charges to which it becomes subject.
