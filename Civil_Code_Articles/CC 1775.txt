Art. 1775.  Effects retroactive
Fulfillment of a condition has effects that are retroactive to the inception of the obligation.  Nevertheless, that fulfillment does not impair the validity of acts of administration duly performed by a party, nor affect the ownership of fruits produced while the condition was pending.  Likewise, fulfillment of the condition does not impair the right acquired by third persons while the condition was pending.
