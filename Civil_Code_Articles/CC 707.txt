Art. 707.  Servitudes; apparent or nonapparent.
Predial servitudes are either apparent or nonapparent.  Apparent servitudes are those that are perceivable by exterior signs, works, or constructions; such as a roadway, a window in a common wall, or an aqueduct.
Nonapparent servitudes are those that have no exterior sign of their existence; such as the prohibition of building on an estate or of building above a particular height.
