Art. 2695.  Attachments, additions, or other improvements to leased thing
In the absence of contrary agreement, upon termination of the lease, the rights and obligations of the parties with regard to attachments, additions, or other improvements made to the leased thing by the lessee are as follows:
(1)  The lessee may remove all improvements that he made to the leased thing, provided that he restore the thing to its former condition.
(2)  If the lessee does not remove the improvements, the lessor may:
(a)  Appropriate ownership of the improvements by reimbursing the lessee for their costs or for the enhanced value of the leased thing whichever is less; or
(b)  Demand that the lessee remove the improvements within a reasonable time and restore the leased thing to its former condition.  If the lessee fails to do so, the lessor may remove the improvements and restore the leased thing to its former condition at the expense of the lessee or appropriate ownership of the improvements without any obligation of reimbursement to the lessee.  Appropriation of the improvement by the lessor may only be accomplished by providing additional notice by certified mail to the lessee after expiration of the time given the lessee to remove the improvements.
(c)  Until such time as the lessor appropriates the improvement, the improvements shall remain the property of the lessee and the lessee shall be solely responsible for any harm caused by the improvements.
