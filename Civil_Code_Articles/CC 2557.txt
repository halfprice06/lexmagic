Art. 2557.  Eviction and threat of eviction as grounds for suspension of payment
A buyer who is evicted by the claim of a third person may withhold payment of the price until he is restored to possession, unless the seller gives security for any loss the buyer may sustain as a result of the eviction.
A seller who, in such a case, is unable or unwilling to give security may compel the buyer to deposit the price with the court until the right of the third person is adjudged.  Also the buyer may deposit the price with the court, on his own initiative, to prevent the accrual of interest.
A buyer may not withhold payment of the price when the seller is not liable for a return of the price in case of eviction.
