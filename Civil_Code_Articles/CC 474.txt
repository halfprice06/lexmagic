Art. 474.  Movables by anticipation.
Unharvested crops and ungathered fruits of trees are movables by anticipation when they belong to a person other than the landowner.  When encumbered with security rights of third persons, they are movables by anticipation insofar as the creditor is concerned.
The landowner may, by act translative of ownership or by pledge, mobilize by anticipation unharvested crops and ungathered fruits of trees that belong to him.
