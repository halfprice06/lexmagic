Art. 2709.  Lessor's right to seize movables of third persons
The lessor may lawfully seize a movable that belongs to a third person if it is located in or upon the leased property, unless the lessor knows that the movable is not the property of the lessee.
The third person may recover the movable by establishing his ownership prior to the judicial sale in the manner provided by Article 1092 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  If he fails to do so, the movable may be sold as though it belonged to the lessee.
