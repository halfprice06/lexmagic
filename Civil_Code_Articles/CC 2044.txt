SECTION 2.  OBLIQUE ACTION
Art. 2044.  Insolvency by failure to exercise right
If an obligor causes or increases his insolvency by failing to exercise a right, the obligee may exercise it himself, unless the right is strictly personal to the obligor.
For that purpose, the obligee must join in the suit his obligor and the third person against whom that right is asserted.
