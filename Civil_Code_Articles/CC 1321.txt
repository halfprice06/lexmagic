Art. 1321. Â Separate possession of one co-owner, partition before prescription.
It follows from the provisions of the preceding article that the partition can be demanded, even though one of the heirs should have enjoyed some part of the estate * separately, if there has been no act of partition, nor possession sufficient to acquire prescription.
* Note error in English translation of French text; "estate" should be "effects of the succession."
