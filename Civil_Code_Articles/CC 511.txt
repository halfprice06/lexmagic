Art. 511.  Ownership of new thing made with materials of another.
When one uses materials of another to make a new thing, the thing belongs to the owner of the materials, regardless of whether they may be given their earlier form.  The owner is bound to reimburse the value of the workmanship.
Nevertheless, when the value of the workmanship substantially exceeds that of the materials, the thing belongs to him who made it.  In this case, he is bound to reimburse the owner of the materials their value.
