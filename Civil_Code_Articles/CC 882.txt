Art. 882.  Representation in direct line of descendants
Representation takes place ad infinitum in the direct line of descendants.  It is permitted in all cases, whether the children of the deceased concur with the descendants of the predeceased child, or whether, all the children having died before him, the descendants of the children be in equal or unequal degrees of relationship to the deceased.  For purposes of forced heirship, representation takes place only as provided in Article 1493.
