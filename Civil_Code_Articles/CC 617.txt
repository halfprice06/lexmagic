Art. 617.  Proceeds of insurance.
When proceeds of insurance are due on account of loss, extinction, or destruction of property subject to usufruct, the usufruct attaches to the proceeds.  If the usufructuary or the naked owner has separately insured his interest only, the proceeds belong to the insured party.
