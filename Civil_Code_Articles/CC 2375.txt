Art. 2375.  Effect of judgment
            A.  Except as provided in Paragraph C of this Article, a judgment decreeing
separation of property terminates the regime of community property retroactively to the day
of the filing of the petition or motion therefor, without prejudice to rights validly acquired
in the interim between filing of the petition or motion and rendition of judgment.
            B.  If a judgment has been rendered, in accordance with Article 2374(C) or (D), a
reconciliation reestablishes the regime of community property between the spouses
retroactively to the day of its termination, unless prior to the reconciliation the spouses
execute a matrimonial agreement to the contrary.  This agreement need not be approved by
the court and is effective toward third persons when filed for registry in the manner provided
by Article 2332.  The reestablishment of the community is effective toward third persons
when a notice thereof is filed for registry in the same manner.
            C.  If a judgment is rendered on the ground that the spouses were living separate and
apart without having reconciled for at least thirty days from the date of, or prior to, the filing
of the petition for divorce, the judgment shall be effective retroactively to the date the
petition for divorce was filed, without prejudice to rights validly acquired in the interim.
