Art. 893.  Brothers and sisters related by half-blood
           The property that devolves to the brothers or sisters is divided among
them equally, if they are all born of the same parents.  If they are born of
different unions, it is equally divided between the paternal and maternal lines
of the deceased: brothers or sisters fully related by blood take in both lines and
those related by half-blood take each in his own line.  If there are brothers or
sisters on one side only, they take the entirety to the exclusion of all relations
in the other line.
