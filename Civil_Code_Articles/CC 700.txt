Art. 700.  Servitude of support.
The servitude of support is the right by which buildings or other constructions of the dominant estate are permitted to rest on a wall of the servient estate.
Unless the title provides otherwise, the owner of the servient estate is bound to keep the wall fit for the exercise of the servitude, but he may be relieved of this charge by abandoning the wall.
