Art. 620.  Sale of the property or of the usufruct
Usufruct terminates by the enforcement of an encumbrance established upon the property prior to the creation of the usufruct to secure a debt.  The usufructuary may have an action against the grantor of the usufruct or against the naked owner under the provisions established in Section 3 of this Chapter.
The judicial sale of the usufruct by creditors of the usufructuary deprives the usufructuary of his enjoyment of the property but does not terminate the usufruct.
