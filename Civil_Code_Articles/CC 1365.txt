Art. 1365.  Equality in formation of lots.
In the formation and composition of the lots, care must be taken to avoid as much as possible the cantling of tenements, and not to separate what is necessary for the same cultivation.  And there ought to be included, if possible, in each lot, the same quantity of movables, immovables, rights and credits of the same nature and * value.
* Note error in English translation of French text; "and" should be "or."
