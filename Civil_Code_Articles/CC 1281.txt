Art. 1281.  Alienation of immovable by donee by onerous title; creation of real right in immovable by donee or operation of law
A.  If the donee who owes the collation has alienated by onerous title the immovable given to him, the coheirs shall not have the right to claim the immovable in the hands of the transferee.
B.  If the donee who owes the collation has created a real right by onerous title in the immovable given to him or such right has been created by operation of law since the donee received the immovable, the coheirs may claim the immovable in the hands of the donee but subject to such real right as has been created.  In such a case, the donee and his successors by gratuitous title are accountable for the resulting diminution of the value of the property.
