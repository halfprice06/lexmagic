Art. 715.  Exercise of the servitude.
A co-owner who has consented to the establishment of a predial servitude on the entire estate owned in indivision may not prevent its exercise on the ground that the consent of his co-owner has not been obtained.
If he becomes owner of the whole estate by any means which terminates the indivision, the predial servitude to which he has consented burdens his property.
