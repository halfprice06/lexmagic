Art. 2750. Â Liability of laborer leaving employment without cause.
But if, on the other hand, a laborer, after having hired out his services, should leave his employer before the time of his engagement has expired, without having any just cause of complaint against his employer, the laborer shall then forfeit all the wages that may be due to him, and shall moreover be compelled to repay all the money he has received, either as due for his wages, or in advance thereof*on the running year or on the time of his engagement.
*Note error in English translation of French text; "either as due for his wages, or in advance thereof" should be "in advance."
