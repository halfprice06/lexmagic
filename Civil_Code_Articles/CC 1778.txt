Art. 1778.  Term for performance
A term for the performance of an obligation is a period of time either certain or uncertain.  It is certain when it is fixed.  It is uncertain when it is not fixed but is determinable either by the intent of the parties or by the occurrence of a future and certain event.  It is also uncertain when it is not determinable, in which case the obligation must be performed within a reasonable time.
