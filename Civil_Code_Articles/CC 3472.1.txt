Art. 3472.1.  Emergency suspension of prescription and peremption
            Notwithstanding any other provision of the law or any provision of an executive order
or proclamation, in the event the governor, in response to a state of emergency or disaster,
issues an executive order or proclamation pursuant to R.S. 29:721 through 775 that purports
to suspend or extend liberative prescriptive or peremptive periods in all or part of the state,
the executive order or proclamation shall have the effect of suspending only those liberative
prescriptive or peremptive periods that would have otherwise accrued during the period of
time specified in the order or proclamation or, if no period of time is specified, during the
duration of the effectiveness of the executive order or proclamation.  Upon the termination
of the period of suspension, liberative prescription or peremption commences to run again
and accrues upon the earlier of thirty days after the expiration of the period of suspension or
in accordance with the period of time as calculated pursuant to Article 3472.
