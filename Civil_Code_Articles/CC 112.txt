Art. 112.  Determination of final periodic support
            A.  When a spouse has not been at fault prior to the filing of a petition for divorce and
is in need of support, based on the needs of that party and the ability of the other party to pay,
that spouse may be awarded final periodic support in accordance with Paragraph B of this
Article.
            B.  The court shall consider all relevant factors in determining the amount and
duration of final support, including:
            (1)  The income and means of the parties, including the liquidity of such means.
            (2)  The financial obligations of the parties, including any interim allowance or final
child support obligation.
            (3)  The earning capacity of the parties.
            (4)  The effect of custody of children upon a party's earning capacity.
            (5)  The time necessary for the claimant to acquire appropriate education, training,
or employment.
            (6)  The health and age of the parties.
            (7)  The duration of the marriage.
            (8)  The tax consequences to either or both parties.
            (9)  The existence, effect, and duration of any act of domestic abuse committed by
the other spouse upon the claimant or a child of one of the spouses, regardless of whether the
other spouse was prosecuted for the act of domestic violence.
            C.  When a spouse is awarded a judgment of divorce pursuant to Article 103(2), (3),
(4), or (5), or when the court determines that a party or a child of one of the spouses was the
victim of domestic abuse committed by the other party during the marriage, that spouse is
presumed to be entitled to final periodic support.
            D.  The sum awarded under this Article shall not exceed one-third of the obligor's net
income.  Nevertheless, when support is awarded after a judgment of divorce is rendered
pursuant to Article 103(4) or (5), or when the court determines that a party or a child of one
of the spouses was the victim of domestic abuse committed by the other party during the
marriage, the sum awarded may exceed one-third of the obligor's net income and may be
awarded as a lump sum.
