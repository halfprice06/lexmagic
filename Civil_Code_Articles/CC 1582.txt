Art. 1582.  Effect of witness or notary as legatee
The fact that a witness or the notary is a legatee does not invalidate the testament.  A legacy to a witness or the notary is invalid, but if the witness would be an heir in intestacy, the witness may receive the lesser of his intestate share or the legacy in the testament.
