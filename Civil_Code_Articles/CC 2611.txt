Art. 2611.  Resale by the seller
When the buyer fails to perform a contract of sale of movable things, the seller, within a reasonable time and in good faith, may resell those things that are still in his possession.  In such a case the seller is entitled to recover the difference between the contract price and the resale price.  The seller may recover also other damages, less the expenses saved as a result of the buyer's failure to perform.
Unless the things are perishable or subject to rapid decline in value, the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice of the public sale at which the things will be resold, or of his intention to resell the things at a private sale.
