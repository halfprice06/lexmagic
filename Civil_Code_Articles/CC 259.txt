Art. 259. Â Option of acceptance of tutorship.
The tutor by will is not compelled to accept the tutorship to which he is appointed by the father or mother.
But if he refuses the tutorship, he loses in that case all the legacies and other advantages, which the person who appointed him may have made in his favor under a persuasion that he would accept this trust.
