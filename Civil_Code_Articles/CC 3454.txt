Art. 3454.  Computation of time 
In computing a prescriptive period, the day that marks the commencement of prescription is not counted.  Prescription accrues upon the expiration of the last day of the prescriptive period, and if that day is a legal holiday, prescription accrues upon the expiration of the next day that is not a legal holiday.
