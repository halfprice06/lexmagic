Art. 134.  Factors in determining child's best interest
             A.  Except as provided in Paragraph B of this Article, the court shall consider all
relevant factors in determining the best interest of the child, including:
            (1)  The potential for the child to be abused, as defined by Children's Code Article
603, which shall be the primary consideration.
            (2)  The love, affection, and other emotional ties between each party and the child.
            (3)  The capacity and disposition of each party to give the child love, affection, and
spiritual guidance and to continue the education and rearing of the child.
            (4)  The capacity and disposition of each party to provide the child with food,
clothing, medical care, and other material needs.
            (5)  The length of time the child has lived in a stable, adequate environment, and the
desirability of maintaining continuity of that environment.
            (6)  The permanence, as a family unit, of the existing or proposed custodial home or
homes.
            (7)  The moral fitness of each party, insofar as it affects the welfare of the child.
            (8)  The history of substance abuse, violence, or criminal activity of any party.
            (9)  The mental and physical health of each party. Evidence that an abused parent
suffers from the effects of past abuse by the other parent shall not be grounds for denying that
parent custody.
            (10)  The home, school, and community history of the child.
            (11)  The reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the child to be of
sufficient age to express a preference.
            (12)  The willingness and ability of each party to facilitate and encourage a close and
continuing relationship between the child and the other party, except when objectively
substantial evidence of specific abusive, reckless, or illegal conduct has caused one party to
have reasonable concerns for the child's safety or well-being while in the care of the other
party.
            (13)  The distance between the respective residences of the parties.
            (14)  The responsibility for the care and rearing of the child previously exercised by
each party.
            B.  In cases involving a history of committing family violence, as defined in R.S.
9:362, or domestic abuse, as defined in R.S. 46:2132, including sexual abuse, as defined in
R.S. 14:403(A)(4)(b), whether or not a party has sought relief under any applicable law, the
court shall determine an award of custody or visitation in accordance with R.S. 9:341 and
364.  The court may only find a history of committing family violence if the court finds that
one incident of family violence has resulted in serious bodily injury or the court finds more
than one incident of family violence.
