SECTION 4.  ACCEPTANCE OF SUCCESSION BY CREDITORS
Art. 967.  Acceptance of succession by creditor
A creditor of a successor may, with judicial authorization, accept succession rights in the successor's name if the successor has renounced them in whole or in part to the prejudice of his creditor's rights.  In such a case, the renunciation may be annulled in favor of the creditor to the extent of his claim against the successor, but it remains effective against the successor.
