Art. 473.  Incorporeal movables.
Rights, obligations, and actions that apply to a movable thing are incorporeal movables.  Movables of this kind are such as bonds, annuities, and interests or shares in entities possessing juridical personality.
Interests or shares in a juridical person that owns immovables are considered as movables as long as the entity exists; upon its dissolution, the right of each individual to a share in the immovables is an immovable.
