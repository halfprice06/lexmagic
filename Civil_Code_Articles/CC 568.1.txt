Art. 568.1.  Donation and alienation
If a thing subject to the usufruct is donated inter vivos by the usufructuary, he is obligated to pay to the naked owner at the termination of the usufruct the value of the thing as of the time of the donation.  If a thing subject to the usufruct is otherwise alienated by the usufructuary, the usufruct attaches to any money or other property received by the usufructuary.  The property received shall be classified as consumable or nonconsumable in accordance with the provisions of this Title, and the usufruct shall be governed by those provisions subject to the terms of the act establishing the original usufruct.  If, at the time of the alienation, the value of the property received by the usufructuary is less than the value of the thing alienated, the usufructuary is bound to pay the difference to the naked owner at the termination of the usufruct.
