            A.  The mother is of right the tutrix of her child born outside of marriage not
acknowledged by the father, or acknowledged by him without her concurrence.
            B.  After the death of the mother, if the father had not acknowledged the child prior
to the mother's death, the court shall give first consideration to appointment as tutor either
of her parents or siblings who survive her and accept the appointment, and secondly, the
father, always taking into consideration the best interests of the child.
            C.  If both parents have acknowledged their child born outside of marriage, the judge
shall appoint as tutor the one by whose care the best interests of the child will be served.
However, if the parents are awarded joint custody of such acknowledged child born outside
of marriage, then the cotutorship of such child shall belong of right to both parents, with
equal authority to act alone, on behalf of the child, and with equal privileges and
responsibilities, unless modified by order of the court or by an agreement of the parents,
approved by the court awarding joint custody.
