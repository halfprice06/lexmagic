Art. 1283.  Collation of movables.
When movables have been given, the donee is not permitted to collate them in kind; he is bound to collate for them by taking less, according to their appraised value at the time of the donation, if there be any annexed to the donation.  In default thereof, recourse may be had to other evidence to establish the value of these movables at the time of the donation.
