Art. 1250. Â Immovables destroyed while in possession of donee.
Immovable property, given by a father, mother or other ascendant, to one of their children or descendants, and which has been destroyed by accident, while in the possession of the donee and without his fault, previous to the opening of the succession, is not subject to collation.
