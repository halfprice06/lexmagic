Art. 1566.  Revocation or dissolution, donee's liability for fruits
When a donation is revoked or dissolved, the donee or his successor is bound to restore or to pay the value of the fruits and products of the things given from the date of written demand.
If the donation is dissolved for nonperformance of a condition or a charge that the donee had the power to perform, the court may order the donee or his successor to restore the value of the fruits and products received after his failure to perform if the failure to perform is due to his fault.
