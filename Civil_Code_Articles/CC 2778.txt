TITLE X.  ANNUITIES
CHAPTER 1.  ANNUITY CONTRACT
Art. 2778.  Annuity contract; definition
An annuity contract is an agreement by which a party delivers a thing to another who binds himself to make periodic payments to a designated recipient.  The recipient's right to these payments is called an annuity.
A contract transferring ownership of a thing other than money for a certain or determinable price payable over a term is not an annuity contract.
