Art. 186.  Presumption if child is born after divorce or after death of husband; effect of disavowal
If a child is born within three hundred days from the day of the termination of a marriage and his mother has married again before his birth, the first husband is presumed to be the father.
If the first husband, or his successor, obtains a judgment of disavowal of paternity of the child, the second husband is presumed to be the father.  The second husband, or his successor, may disavow paternity if he institutes a disavowal action within a peremptive period of one year from the day that the judgment of disavowal obtained by the first husband is final and definitive.
Amended by Acts 1976, No. 430, §1; Acts 2005, No. 192, §1, eff. June 29, 2005.

Sarah was married to Mark, and their marriage was officially terminated on January 1, 2023. Sarah then married Tom on February 1, 2023. She gave birth to a child, named Emily, on October 1, 2023. Mark obtains a judgment of disavowal of paternity on January 1, 2024, stating that he is not Emily's father. After Mark successfully obtains a judgment of disavowal on January 1, 2024, who is then presumed to be Emily's father?
