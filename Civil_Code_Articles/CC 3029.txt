Art. 3029.  Termination by the mandatary
            The mandate and the authority of the mandatary terminate when the mandatary
notifies the principal of his resignation or renunciation of his authority.  When a mandatary
has reasonable grounds to believe that the principal lacks capacity, the termination is
effective only when the mandatary notifies another mandatary or a designated successor
mandatary.  In the absence of another mandatary or a designated successor mandatary, the
termination is effective when the mandatary notifies a person with a sufficient interest in the
welfare of the principal.
