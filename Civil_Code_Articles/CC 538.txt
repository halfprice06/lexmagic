Art. 538.  Usufruct of consumable things
If the things subject to the usufruct are consumables, the usufructuary becomes owner of them.  He may consume, alienate, or encumber them as he sees fit.  At the termination of the usufruct he is bound either to pay to the naked owner  the value that the things had at the commencement of the usufruct or to deliver to him things of the same quantity and quality.
