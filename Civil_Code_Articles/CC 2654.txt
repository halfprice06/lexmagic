Art. 2654.  Documents evidencing the right
The assignor of a right must deliver to the assignee all documents in his possession that evidence the right.  Nevertheless, a failure by the assignor to deliver such documents does not affect the validity of the assignment.
When a right is assigned only in part, the assignor may give the assignee an original or a copy of such documents.
