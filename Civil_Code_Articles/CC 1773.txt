Art. 1773.  Time for fulfillment of condition that an event shall occur
If the condition is that an event shall occur within a fixed time and that time elapses without the occurrence of the event, the condition is considered to have failed.
If no time has been fixed for the occurrence of the event, the condition may be fulfilled within a reasonable time.
Whether or not a time has been fixed, the condition is considered to have failed once it is certain that the event will not occur.
