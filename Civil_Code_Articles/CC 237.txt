Art. 237.  Obligation of providing the basic necessities of life; ascendants and descendants;
exceptions
            Descendants are bound to provide the basic necessities of life to their ascendants who
are in need, upon proof of inability to obtain these necessities by other means or from other
sources, and ascendants are likewise bound to provide for their needy descendants, this
obligation being reciprocal.
            This obligation is strictly personal and is limited to the basic necessities of food,
clothing, shelter, and health care.
            This obligation is owed by descendants and ascendants in the order of their degree
of relationship to the obligee and is joint and divisible among obligors.  Nevertheless, if the
obligee is married, the obligation of support owed by his descendants and ascendants is
secondary to the obligation owed by his spouse.
