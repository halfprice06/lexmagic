Art. 2628.  Time limitation for option and right of first refusal
An option or a right of first refusal that concerns an immovable thing may not be granted for a term longer than ten years.  If a longer time for an option or a right of first refusal has been stipulated in a contract, that time shall be reduced to ten years.  Nevertheless, if the option or right of first refusal is granted in connection with a contract that gives rise to obligations of continuous or periodic performance, an option or a right of first refusal may be granted for as long a period as required for the performance of those obligations.
