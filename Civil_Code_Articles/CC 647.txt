Art. 647.  Benefit to dominant estate.
There must be a benefit to the dominant estate.  The benefit need not exist at the time the servitude is created; a possible convenience or a future advantage suffices to support a servitude.
There is no predial servitude if the charge imposed cannot be reasonably expected to benefit the dominant estate.
Acts 1977, No. 514, §1.
