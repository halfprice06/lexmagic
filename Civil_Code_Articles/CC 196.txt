SUBSECTION C.  OTHER METHODS OF ESTABLISHING PATERNITY
Art. 196.  Formal acknowledgment; presumption
            A man may, by authentic act, acknowledge a child not filiated to another man.  The
acknowledgment creates a presumption that the man who acknowledges the child is the
father.  The presumption can be invoked only on behalf of the child.  Except as otherwise
provided in custody, visitation, and child support cases, the acknowledgment does not create
a presumption in favor of the man who acknowledges the child.
