is greater than the fraction of the decedent's estate to which the forced heir would succeed

If the extent delivered by the seller is greater than that specified in the contract, the buyer must pay to the seller a proportionate supplement of the price.  The buyer may recede from the sale when the actual extent of the immovable sold exceeds by more than one twentieth the extent specified in the contract.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,7.  OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLER,,
2494,Sale of immovable for lump price,"When the sale of an immovable has been made with indication of the extent of the premises, but for a lump price, the expression of the measure does not give the seller the right to a proportionate increase of the price, nor does it give the buyer the right to a proportionate diminution of the price, unless there is a surplus, or a shortage, of more than one twentieth of the extent specified in the act of sale.
When the surplus is such as to give the seller the right to an increase of the price the buyer has the option either to pay that increase or to recede from the contract.

If the right of the third person is perfected only after the sale through the negligence of the buyer, though it arises from facts that took place before, the buyer has no claim in warranty.

Such a transfer does not give rise to a presumption of bad faith on the part of the transferee and is a just title for the purposes of acquisitive prescription.
If the transferor acquires ownership of the thing after having transferred his rights to it, the after-acquired title of the transferor does not inure to the benefit of the transferee.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,8.  EVICTION,,
2503,"Modification or exclusion of warranty, seller's liability for personal acts, restitution of price in case of eviction","The warranty against eviction is implied in every sale.  Nevertheless, the parties may agree to increase or to limit the warranty.  They may also agree to an exclusion of the warranty, but even in that case the seller must return the price to the buyer if eviction occurs, unless it is clear that the buyer was aware of the danger of eviction, or the buyer has declared that he was buying at his peril and risk, or the seller's obligation of returning the price has been expressly excluded.
In all those cases the seller is liable for an eviction that is occasioned by his own act, and any agreement to the contrary is null.
The buyer is subrogated to the rights in warranty of the seller against other persons, even when the warranty is excluded.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,8.  EVICTION,,
2506,Rights of buyer against seller in case of eviction,"A buyer who avails himself of the warranty against eviction may recover from the seller the price he paid, the value of any fruits he had to return to the third person who evicted him, and also other damages sustained because of the eviction with the exception of any increase in value of the thing lost.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,8.  EVICTION,,
2507,"Restitution of full price despite deterioration, deduction of damage when benefit to buyer","A seller liable for eviction must return the full price to the buyer even if, at the time of the eviction, the value of the thing has been diminished due to any cause including the buyer's neglect.

2513,Scope of warranty in sale of succession rights,"In a sale of a right of succession, the warranty against eviction extends only to the right to succeed the decedent, which entitles the buyer to those things that are, in fact, a part of the estate, but it does not extend to any particular thing.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,8.  EVICTION,,
2517,"Call in warranty, failure of buyer to call seller in warranty, suit to quiet possession","A buyer threatened with eviction must give timely notice of the threat to the seller.  If a suit for eviction has been brought against the buyer, his calling in the seller to defend that suit amounts to such notice.
A buyer who elects to bring suit against a third person who disturbs his peaceful possession of the thing sold must give timely notice of that suit to the seller.
In either case, a buyer who fails to give such notice, or who fails to give it in time for the seller to defend himself, forfeits the warranty against eviction if the seller can show that, had he been notified in time, he would have been able to prove that the third person who sued the buyer had no right.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,8.  EVICTION,,
2520,Warranty against redhibitory defects,"The seller warrants the buyer against redhibitory defects, or vices, in the thing sold.
A defect is redhibitory when it renders the thing useless, or its use so inconvenient that it must be presumed that a buyer would not have bought the thing had he known of the defect.  The existence of such a defect gives a buyer the right to obtain rescission of the sale.
A defect is redhibitory also when, without rendering the thing totally useless, it diminishes its usefulness or its value so that it must be presumed that a buyer would still have bought it but for a lesser price.  The existence of such a defect limits the right of a buyer to a reduction of the price.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,9.  REDHIBITION,,
2521,Defects that are made known to the buyer or that are apparent,"The seller owes no warranty for defects in the thing that were known to the buyer at the time of the sale, or for defects that should have been discovered by a reasonably prudent buyer of such things.

2522,Notice of existence of defect,"The buyer must give the seller notice of the existence of a redhibitory defect in the thing sold.  That notice must be sufficiently timely as to allow the seller the opportunity to make the required repairs.  A buyer who fails to give that notice suffers diminution of the warranty to the extent the seller can show that the defect could have been repaired or that the repairs would have been less burdensome, had he received timely notice.
Such notice is not required when the seller has actual knowledge of the existence of a redhibitory defect in the thing sold.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,9.  REDHIBITION,,
2524,Thing fit for ordinary use,"The thing sold must be reasonably fit for its ordinary use.
When the seller has reason to know the particular use the buyer intends for the thing, or the buyer's particular purpose for buying the thing, and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment in selecting it, the thing sold must be fit for the buyer's intended use or for his particular purpose.
If the thing is not so fit, the buyer's rights are governed by the general rules of conventional obligations.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,9.  REDHIBITION,,
2529,Thing not of the kind specified in the contract,"When the thing the seller has delivered, though in itself free from redhibitory defects, is not of the kind or quality specified in the contract or represented by the seller, the rights of the buyer are governed by other rules of sale and conventional obligations.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,9.  REDHIBITION,,
2530,Defect must exist before delivery,"The warranty against redhibitory defects covers only defects that exist at the time of delivery.  The defect shall be presumed to have existed at the time of delivery if it appears within three days from that time.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,9.  REDHIBITION,,
2531,Liability of seller who knew not of the defect,"A seller who did not know that the thing he sold had a defect is only bound to repair, remedy, or correct the defect.  If he is unable or fails so to do, he is then bound to return the price to the buyer with interest from the time it was paid, and to reimburse him for the reasonable expenses occasioned by the sale, as well as those incurred for the preservation of the thing, less the credit to which the seller is entitled if the use made of the thing, or the fruits it has yielded, were of some value to the buyer.
A seller who is held liable for a redhibitory defect has an action against the manufacturer of the defective thing, if the defect existed at the time the thing was delivered by the manufacturer to the seller, for any loss the seller sustained because of the redhibition.  Any contractual provision that attempts to limit, diminish or prevent such recovery by a seller against the manufacturer shall have no effect.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,9.  REDHIBITION,,
2532,Return of the thing; destruction of the thing,"A buyer who obtains rescission because of a redhibitory defect is bound to return the thing to the seller, for which purpose he must take care of the thing as a prudent administrator, but is not bound to deliver it back until all his claims, or judgments, arising from the defect are satisfied.
If the redhibitory defect has caused the destruction of the thing the loss is borne by the seller, and the buyer may bring his action even after the destruction has occurred.
If the thing is destroyed by a fortuitous event before the buyer gives the seller notice of the existence of a redhibitory defect that would have given rise to a rescission of the sale, the loss is borne by the buyer.
After such notice is given, the loss is borne by the seller, except to the extent the buyer has insured that loss.  A seller who returns the price, or a part thereof, is subrogated to the buyer's right against third persons who may be liable for the destruction of the thing.

2534,Prescription,"A.  The action for redhibition against a seller who did not know of the existence of
a defect in the thing sold and the action asserting that a thing is not fit for its ordinary or
intended use prescribe in two years  from the day of delivery of the thing to the buyer or one
year from the day the defect or unfitness was discovered by the buyer, whichever occurs first.

known, of the existence of a defect in the thing sold prescribes in one year from the day the
defect was discovered by the buyer or ten years from the perfection of the contract of sale,
whichever occurs first.
            C.  In any case prescription on an action for redhibition is interrupted when the seller

buyer or notifies the buyer of his refusal or inability to make the required repairs.

The same rules apply if a thing with a redhibitory defect is transferred, inter vivos or mortis causa, to multiple successors.

2541,Reduction of the price,"A buyer may choose to seek only reduction of the price even when the redhibitory defect is such as to give him the right to obtain rescission of the sale.
In an action for rescission because of a redhibitory defect the court may limit the remedy of the buyer to a reduction of the price.
",III OF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACQUIRING THE OWNERSHIP OF THINGS PRELIMINARY,VII - OF SALE,9.  REDHIBITION,,
2545,Liability of seller who knows of the defect; presumption of knowledge,"A seller who knows that the thing he sells has a defect but omits to declare it, or a seller who declares that the thing has a quality that he knows it does not have, is liable to the buyer for the return of the price with interest from the time it was paid, for the reimbursement of the reasonable expenses occasioned by the sale and those incurred for the preservation of the thing, and also for damages and reasonable attorney fees.  If the use made of the thing, or the fruits it might have yielded, were of some value to the buyer, such a seller may be allowed credit for such use or fruits.
